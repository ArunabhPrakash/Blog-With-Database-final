/*
The code you provided is using a templating engine, likely EJS, to dynamically render content in an HTML document. Let's break it down:

1.
   - This code includes the content of the "header" partial file at this position in the HTML document. The `-` characters are used to trim any whitespace that might be generated during the inclusion process.

2.
   - This line renders an HTML heading element (`<h1>`) with the text "Home".

3.
   - This line renders a paragraph element (`<p>`) with the content of the `startingContent` variable interpolated in the document. The `<%= %>` syntax is used to output the value of the `startingContent` variable within the paragraph.

4.
   - This line starts a loop over the `posts` array. It iterates through each `post` object in the array and executes the code within the loop.

5.
   - This line renders an HTML heading element (`<h1>`) with the value of the `title` property of each `post` object.

6.
   - This line renders a paragraph element (`<p>`) with the truncated content of each `post` object. The `substring(0, 100)` function is used to limit the content to the first 100 characters, and the ellipsis ("...") is added at the end.

7.
   - This line renders an anchor element (`<a>`) with a link to the individual post page. The `post._id` value is used in the URL to identify the specific post.

8.
   - This line marks the end of the loop over the `posts` array.

9. 
   - This code includes the content of the "footer" partial file at this position in the HTML document. The `-` characters are used to trim any whitespace that might be generated during the inclusion process.
Overall, this code suggests that there is a collection of `posts` available, and the code iterates over each post to display its title, truncated content, and a "Read More" link. The header and footer partials are included to provide consistent structure and styling to the HTML document.
