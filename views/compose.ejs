/*
The code you provided is using a templating engine, likely EJS, to dynamically render content in an HTML document. Let's break it down:

1.
   - This code includes the content of the "header" partial file at this position in the HTML document. The `-` characters are used to trim any whitespace that might be generated during the inclusion process.

2.
   - This line renders an HTML heading element (`<h1>`) with the text "Compose".

3.
   - This line starts an HTML form with an action set to "/compose" and a method set to "post". This form is used to submit data to the "/compose" route.

4.
   - This line starts a div element with the class "form-group". This class is commonly used in Bootstrap to style form elements.

5.
   - This line renders an HTML label element with the text "Title".

6.
   - This line renders an HTML input element of type "text" with the class "form-control". The name attribute is set to "postTitle", which is used to identify the input when the form is submitted.

7.
   - This line renders an HTML label element with the text "Post".

8.
   - This line renders an HTML textarea element with the class "form-control". The name attribute is set to "postBody", which is used to identify the textarea when the form is submitted. The rows and cols attributes define the size of the textarea.

9.
   - This line renders an HTML button element with the classes "btn" and "btn-primary". The type attribute is set to "submit", indicating that this button will submit the form when clicked. The name attribute is set to "button".
10.
    - This line marks the end of the HTML form.
11.
    - This code includes the content of the "footer" partial file at this position in the HTML document. The `-` characters are used to trim any whitespace that might be generated during the inclusion process.
Overall, this code renders a form for composing a new post. It includes input fields for the post's title and content. When the "Publish" button is clicked, the form data is submitted to the "/compose" route. The header and footer partials are included to provide consistent structure and styling to the HTML document.*/
